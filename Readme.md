In this project we are using a real example of the stock market and have created a VBA Script to:
*Summarize for each ticker and per year the opening and closing  price and volume of stock
*Identify the tickers that experienced maximum and minimum percentage change in value per year
*Identify the ticker that experienced maximum volume of exchanged stocks per year

The worksheets with the data used for the work are not included in this report because they are very large: 
    1) a test sheet "alphaetical_testing"
    2) the final sheet "Multiple_year_stock_data"

We included:
    * Screen shots of the results for the years 2014, 2015, 2016
        Note: screenshots only include the top portion of the spreadsheets
    * VBA Script (working version) for the testing dataset (.txt format)
    * VBA Script (clean) for the full dataset in three different formats created in Notepad++
        .vbs, .tex, .csl
